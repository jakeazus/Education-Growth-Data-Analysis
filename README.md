# Project - 1 - Education Analysis of the UK and Spain
## Overview
This project focuses on the growth of education between the United Kingdom and Spain based on various indicators. These indicators were found using a dataset that contained educational stats for European countries. We analyzed factors such as the percentage of the labor force with advanced education, government expenditure on education, unemployment, and the percentage of enrollment for both Male and Female in science tertiary programs. The period of time that are analysis focused on was from 2001 to 2011 as this timeframe was most relatable from the dataset we used. To document our findings with the indicators, we used Jupyter notebook to create several visualizations comparing the UK and Spain.

## Findings
1. How has the population of the official age for secondary education changed from 2001 to 2011 for the UK and Spain?
- Population has remained relatively stable over the ten-year period for both the UK and Spain.
- The UK’s population has been some 2 million higher than Spain through out the ten-year period.
Secondary education - typically takes place after six years of primary education. In most countries secondary education is compulsory, at least until the age of 16. Compulsory education sometimes extends to age 19

2. How has the labor force % with advanced education changed from 2001 to 2011 for the UK and Spain?
 - For both the UK and Spain, the percentage of labor force seemed pretty constant for both male and female with exception to females in Spain. 
 - Based on a study on the Spain labor force, from 1994-2013, occupations in services such as  clerical, service/sales, and professional/elementary became female dominant in the labor market. This can directly correlate with the increase in advanced education for females in Spain from 2001-2011.
 - It’s also important to note  the labor force for both male and females with advanced education most likely had a sharp drop in 2008 due to the massive recession in the US. The 2008 recession clearly had a significant impact on the UK economy. 

3. How has the government expenditure on secondary education changed from 2001 to 2011 for the UK and Spain? 
 - Spain's government shows a slow decrease in government expenditure until 2007 where there was a significant increase in spending. 
 - The UK’s government expenditure has varied over the years with a spike in 2008 and 2009. This may have been in an effort to create more hiring potential to boost the economy after the recession. 

4. Evaluating the percentage of Male and Female enrollments in science tertiary programs in the UK and Spain between the years 2001 to 2011:

 - Both the UK and Spain Males enrolled in science program with a higher percentage than the females.
 - Both countries and genders peaked in 2010 with the enrollment science program.
