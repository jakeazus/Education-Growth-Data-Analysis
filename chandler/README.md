The first question I rased was how has the government expenditure on secondary education changed from 2001 to 2011 for the UK and Spain? 

Spain's government shows a slow decrease in government expenditure until 2007 where there was a significant increase in spending. 

The UK’s government expenditure has varied over the years with a spike in 2008 and 2009. This may have been in an effort to create more hiring potential to boost the economy after the recession. 

It is important to understand that  secondary education funding comes almost entirely from government taxes. Funding presents the opportunity for educational growth. 



The Second question I rased was how has the government expenditure on tertiary education changed from 2001 to 2011 for the UK and Spain? 

Spain's government expenditure for higher education has been on a steady climb since 2006.

The UK’s government expenditure on education was making good progress in the early 2000’s before taking a dive till 2009 where government funding recovered and grew greatly in 2009 and 2010.



Lastly I combined overall unemployment and overall government spending on education over time. This alowed me to see how government expendature and unemployment percentages relate to eachother.

For both Spain and the UK a positive relationship between unemployment going up and increased government going can be seen. This may be in an effort to lower the unemployment rates by focusing on education the existing and future workforce.
