1. How has the labor force % with advanced education changed from 2001 to 2011 for the UK and Spain?
 - For both the UK and Spain, the percentage of labor force seemed pretty constant for both male and female with exception to females in Spain. 
 - Based on a study on the Spain labor force, from 1994-2013, occupations in services such as  clerical, service/sales, and professional/elementary became female dominant in the labor market. This can directly correlate with the increase in advanced education for females in Spain from 2001-2011.
 - It’s also important to note  the labor force for both male and females with advanced education most likely had a sharp drop in 2008 due to the massive recession in the US. The 2008 recession clearly had a significant impact on the UK economy. 

2. How has unemployment varied from 2001-2011 for the UK, Spain, and the United States?
 - Based on the graph, it's interesting to see that unemployment was static from 2001 until 2006 as we can attribute good economic conditions for all three countries during this time.
 - From 2006 to 2011 there was a steady rise in unemployment due to the global recession that all the UK, Spain, and United States all experienced. The more people with advanced educations would result in more jobs lost in the labor force.
 - It’s important to understand  that unemployment % for Spain is a lot higher than both the UK and US due to their smaller labor force total. For instance, the US labor force is comprised of approximately 164 million people compared to Spain’s labor force of only 23 million people.

1. The first question I rased was how has the government expenditure on secondary education changed from 2001 to 2011 for the UK and Spain? 
 - Spain's government shows a slow decrease in government expenditure until 2007 where there was a significant increase in spending. 
 - The UK’s government expenditure has varied over the years with a spike in 2008 and 2009. This may have been in an effort to create more hiring potential to boost the economy after the recession. 

2. The Second question I rased was how has the government expenditure on tertiary education changed from 2001 to 2011 for the UK and Spain? 
 - Spain's government expenditure for higher education has been on a steady climb since 2006.
 - The UK’s government expenditure on education was making good progress in the early 2000’s before taking a dive till 2009 where government funding recovered and grew greatly in 2009 and 2010.

3. Lastly I combined overall unemployment and overall government spending on education over time. This alowed me to see how government expendature and unemployment percentages relate to eachother.
 - For both Spain and the UK a positive relationship between unemployment going up and increased government going can be seen. This may be in an effort to lower the unemployment rates by focusing on education the existing and future workforce
